 *
 * If one device does not support this operation or fails,
 * the whole operation is failed and rolled back.
 *
 * It is forbidden to have multiple flow engines with the same mode

 * The configuration from the active flow engine is effective immediately
 * while the configuration from the standby flow engine is queued by hardware.

 * it has no effect except for below situations:
 *   - traffic not handled by the active flow engine configuration
 *   - no active flow engine
 *
 * When flow engine of a process is changed from a standby to an active mode,
 * all preceding configurations that are queued by hardware
 * should become effective immediately.
 * Before mode transition, all the traffic handling configurations
 * set by the active flow engine should be flushed first.
 *

 * in "old" and "new" applications:
 *   device: already configured by the old application
 *   new:    start as active
 *   new:    probe the same device
 *   new:    set as standby
 *   new:    configure the device
 *   device: has configurations from old and new applications
 *   old:    clear its device configuration
 *   device: has only 1 configuration from new application
 *   new:    set as active
 *   device: downtime for connecting all to the new application
 *   old:    shutdown
 *
 * @param mode
 *   The desired mode `mlx5_flow_engine_mode`.
 * @param flags
 *   Mode specific flags.
 * @return
 *   Positive value on success, -rte_errno value on error:
 *   - (> 0) Number of switched devices.
 *   - (-EINVAL) if error happen and rollback internally.
 *   - (-EPERM) if operation failed and can't recover.
